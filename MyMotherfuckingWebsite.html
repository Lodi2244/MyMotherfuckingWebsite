			<h1>This is <em>MY</em> Motherfucking Website</h1>
			<aside>And it's fucking far from perfect...but perfection is overrated you son-of-a-bitch.</aside>
		</header>

			<h2>Seriously, what else ? (Clooney will smack you in the face! That's what else!)</h2>

				<p>I mean Dude, I feel you, the whole "Perfection is achieved through oversimplification" crap, but let's be real for a second, that kind of bullshit was invented by fucking Norvegian furniture Designers to sell you a goddamn three-legged raw wooden coffe table for 400 fucking bucks ! So don't be a fool it's not minimalism it's a goddamn con ! Now let's review together why ditching CSS doesn't make you a rebel just a lazy motherfucker :</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A little color never hurt no one you tasteless idiot, I mean sure, that's light as fuck but where's the fun, where's the beauty ??!</li>
					<li>And don't get me started on <strong>all</strong> the shitty browsers because if you're using IE7 you're just not worth accessing my fucking website and I will bitchslap your goddamn browser right back to the cretaceous era where it belongs !!</li>
	<!-- Yeah, I'm on fire...Dracarys ! -->
					<li>Now you won't find no hispter drinking coffee pics here brother, but you're the only one quoting Nespresso...i'm just saying.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Well guess what, motherfucker :</h3>

				<p>You.Are.Boring as fuck. I'll animate whatever the fuck I want and make an orgie of floating Game of Throne pics on my page if I feel like it because <mark> I CAN </mark> and you and your sausage finger buddy ain't gonna stop me bitches !</p>

			<h2>Again with the "Light is Right" crap ?</h2>

				<p>Light ain't right unless you're at a skinny bitch contest you moron. But here you're in the big ring and you're sure as hell no baller if you can't lift some weight ! Are you seriously suggesting that Zuckerberg should've turn Facebook into a fucking 404 error page ?! Dude, you're out of line...</p>

			<h2>Unable to respond...to your lack of personality.</h2>

				<p>Let me make a quick analogy here ; Cars. Not the movie you motherfucking idiot. On one hand you have a Renault Clio stick let's say a 80 horsepower Diesel (yeah it's France buddy get over it). It's responsive, sure, get's the job done well enough because they kept it simple, right ? Now on the other hand you have, say an Alfa Romeo MiTo (yeah still in Europe) 135 horsepower gas but automatic this time, well that fully-loaded-electronics crap is sure making your life miserable...sometimes, but <em>when it works</em> you're in for a joyride because it's packing goddamn technology !! So here's the secret ; it should look and feel simple <strong>BECAUSE</strong> of the fucking design's complexity !</p>

			<h2>My shit fucking works...most of the time.</h2>

				<p>Oh I can read alright, and all I can read into your fucking website is a starved-looking HTML5 junkie just longing for it's CSS fix. You're talking about semantics, well what if R. R. Martin had decided to go for your no-style policy ? I'll tell you what, GoT would have gone like this ; "There's an ugly chair. Evreryone wants to sit on it.The End." Boom ! Suck it J. K. Rowling !</p><br>Hell nah...

				<p>You want content ? You've just been served bitch.</p>

				<p>Say Internet Explorer one more time...I fucking dare you.</p>

			<h2>That's no website, that's your fucking diary princess.</h2>

				<p>Now the bearded men analogy, well I sure as hell cannot validate that shit...because I'm a <strong>women</strong> (Shocker !). So sure let's go full-on natural state and leave our body hair be...that ain't the 70's show bitch ! Naked is beautiful, yeah right...after a good waxjob maybe but how about some lingerie, huh ?!</p>

			<h3>No, this is no fucking satire, I'm dead serious motherfucker.</h3>

				<p>Your Motherfucking Website looks like those anorexic cokeheaded boobybootyPhotoshoped models. Feed it a goddamn CSSmeal for Googlesake ! And I've been coding for like 3 full days now, so I think I know my shit...</p>

			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
				<p>Obviously I've been tremendously inspired by the original <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> and I can't wait to CSS the shit out of it in my very own version of the one and only <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com"> Better Motherfucking Website</a> so stay tuned ;)</p>
